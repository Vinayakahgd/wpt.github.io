<div class="box" id="b">
<p> &emsp;To travel from one place to another human have been using vehicles for transportation. Internal combustion (IC) engines are used to drive it. As the vehicle population is increased there is a vast increase in the environmental pollution rate. 
In future days, the concept of pollution free transportation will be of focus. Due to increasing greenhouse gas radiation, and scarcity of petroleum products for upcoming yearâ€™s efficient use of electric vehicles and recharging them portably becomes important.</p>
<p>&emsp;Electric vehicles do not need petroleum products as fuel and the level of pollution caused is negligible when compared to regular vehicles. Hence, electric vehicles and efficient recharging process becomes the major concern.
 Main concern with electrical vehicles is charging. Thus, the concept of wireless power transfer is proposed, where a vehicle can be charged portably.</p>
<p>&emsp;The reason for taking up this project is to make a model of wireless transfer of power for electric vehicles, which will enable dynamic charging in the electric vehicle, thereby increasing its range.
The proposed concept in this paper is to have emitter coils on roads where the traffic moves really slow like toll gates, traffic signals, roundabout, traffic congested areas etc.</p>
<p>&emsp;A receiving coil attached to the belly of the vehicle will receive power from the transmitting coil and charge the battery. Electric vehicle consists of an electric motor, and generally a rechargeable battery which powers the motor.
